I am a sports scientist based in Newcastle Australia. Currently, I am working as a head of sports science for two teams, the Gold Coast Suns Football Club (AFL) and the Newcastle Knights Rugby League Club (NRL). My roles entail developing the sports science programs across both clubs by implementing research driven, innovative practices, utilising athlete tracking technologies such as GPS to assess athlete physical performance. I deal with a lot of data, meaning my skills using R, power BI and other programs comes in handy!
